          <h2>About This Site</h2>
          <p>I am learning how to code for the first time in my life. In here, you'll find two sets of blog:</p> 
          <p>The first one is all about the technical side of programming. The challenge is to present the new concepts I am learning each week, in such a way that my "non-techy" friend will understand.</p>
          <p>The second one is all about how I, as a novice programmer, would develop soft skills for me to succeed in any workplace setting after EDA Bootcamp.</p>
