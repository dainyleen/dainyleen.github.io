                    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Emotional Intelligence, also known as Emotional Quotient(EQ), is the ablity to manage your own emotions and how they affect those around you.
                        People with high EQ form better relationships and are more able to adjust to change. Personally, I've only heard about EQ when I started my first year in Psychology back in 2007.
                        I was fascinated with the different tactics on how to improve my EQ over the years. I am a work in progress. Still, I truly believe that EQ is crucial in every man's daily living.

                        IQ or Intelligence Quotient, on the other hand, is a number that indicates a person's logical ability. The number can be obtained from a standardized intelligence test. 
                        I know a few people who got high IQ scores back in highschool and so they were accepted in the second year of medicine here in New Zealand. One of them was a very good friend of mine. 
                        She shared to me once, that ever since she was a kid, she always excels in her academics especially in numerical and abstract reasoning. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I believe both IQ and EQ are important. They are different for each individual. My IQ determines my individual capacities in any given situation but my EQ determines how I interact and treat people in my life.
                        In the field of software development, both are crucial to my success. I have to keep on using my logical abilities to solve different programming problems. 
                        At the same time, when time gets too complicated for my brain to grasp, how I go about handling my stress and keep on moving forward will help me through.
