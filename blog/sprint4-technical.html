                    <h2>How I Solve Problems</h2>   
                    <p>In my life, I have solved quite a few number of different kinds of problems. My top 2 ways of solving a problem are: Researching/Googling and Reflecting.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scenario One</h3>
                    <p>I love playing Sims4 game. There was this one time, I got bored with playing my sims with only a small amount of Simoleons (money in the real world) over and over again.
                       I wanted my sim to experience living in the mansion which was unoccupied. What did I do? I solved the problem by using <strong>"googling"</strong> this question in my head, <em>"how to acquire lots of simoleons?"</em>
                       It felt so easy because there was this sims4 community already, who were using the "code" to get more Simoleons. I find Google extremely helpful in solving simple problems.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Scenario Two</h3>
                    <p>When I received a call from my facilitator that I would not be moving on to bootcamp last year, I took it as a big problem! I felt like I wasted time and money just because of me.</p>
                       I faced this problem by <strong>"reflecting"</strong> on ways I could improve on in terms of my time management and my ability to focus. I waited for 4 weeks so I can enrol again into another batch of aspiring programmers.
                       While waiting, I subscibed to CodeAcademy and finished the basic html and css courses. I find personal reflection beneficial in solving internal problems.
