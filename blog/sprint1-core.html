                    <h2>My Cultural Identity And Values</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was brought up in a religious family. My family and I go to church every Sunday.
                        We believe in the Bible and we are taught in church to have a close relationship with God.
                        Here's the summary of my personal values:
                        <q>God, husband, extended family/children, work/ministry and friends.</q>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I admit that there are several times wherein my personal values where put to test. 
                        There were stages in my life where I made bad decisions because of my stubborness and there were times wherein I've lost my way.
                        But I have to say, I always seem to gravitate towards God and then I would remember my values in life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love people. I notice over the years, my family and friends come to me for advice when they are facing crossroads in their lives. 
                        They also come to me because I am a good listener. I truly believe God has given me this gift of a "listening ear". 
                        I listen to people through my body language and facial expression. Having said this, I am also introvert by nature. 
                        I don't mind spending time with people but I have to make sure I recharge my energy alone. Spending time just by myself is crucial in my everyday living.
                    </p>
