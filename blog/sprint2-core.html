                    <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started this journey of becoming a software developer late last year. 
                        The year of 2020, as we all know, surprised every nation on Earth with a pandemic!
                        I truly wish I could say that the reason I could not proceed to EDA Bootcamp that started on 4th of January 2021, was because of the pandemic.
                        I will be lying to myself if I say that.
                        The real reason was because of my lack of having a personal learning plan.
                        So to make sure I'll be moving on to bootcamp this time, here's the list of what I'm aiming to accomplish each day for the next five weeks.
