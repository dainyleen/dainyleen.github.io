                    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>   
                    <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt.</p>
                    <p>When we learn something new, we create connections between our neurons. This is so beneficial to know, right?!
                       Especially for us EDA students who are learning how to code, in my case, for the first time! I can use my understanding
                       of Neuroplasticity when I am learning new concepts in programming. I can even increase my brain's neuroplasticity through 
                       these activities:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Sleeping</li>
                          <p>These days, I try my very best to get atleast 7 hours of sleep. I have been going to bed around 10:30pm. It is hard even up to know
                            as I still like watching Netflix or Youtube from my phone, but hey! I now know I can train my brain to achieve this goal.</p>
                        <li>Learning Programming</li>
                          <p>Programming is not for a faint-hearted. Learning how to code expands my logical, abstract and creative capacity.</p>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                          <p>Each morning, I meditate for 5 minutes. And then I will read 3-4 pages from a book on my ipad. I also do this when I go to bed at night. It helps me sleep.</p>    
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Here's a site that I have enjoyed reading while researching this topic, <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/" target="_blank"><em class="link">"What is Neuroplasticity? A Psychologist Explains [+14 Exercises]"</em></a></p>
