                    <h2>Programming Bootcamp</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am "all-in". This was my answer to my facilitators and fellow EDA students on our most recent Zoom Check-In Meeting. I truly mean what I said. I want to become a software developer after EDA's bootcamp.
                        And here's my W-H-Y: Becoming a software developer is a life-long learning! I know when I chose this path that it will be very challenging, yet I also know that the reward of studying programming will immensely satisfy my hunger for learning for life.       
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have gotten to know my main strength that could really help me in bootcamp. I am a good listener. This could really help me especially when the time comes that I need to work with a big team. But there's one thing 
                        I need to watch out for as well - too much listening is not going to be beneficial to the team. I also need to communicate to them my ideas in a respectful manner. On the other hand, I have been working on a solution to my main weakness,
                        that is having a Learning Plan. So here's a short list of my committment:

                        <ol>
                            <li>Attend ALL Zoom Meetings. Be On time.</li>
                            <li>Participate in any group discussions. Learn how to give and receive feedbacks effectively.</li>
                            <li>Practice all the coding materials from Monday to Friday and half-day of Saturday.</li>
                        </ol>

                    </p>
