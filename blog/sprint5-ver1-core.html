                    <h2>Developing Soft Skills</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of five weeks, I have developed a few more important soft skills:</p>
                        
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cultivating A Growth Mindset</li>
                        <p>I firmly believe having a growth mindset while learning to code for the first time has helped me tremendously especially when I was learning new concepts about Javascript functions, arrays and objects!
                            For me, I am more grateful for these core skills I am learning at EDA. I will bring this growth mindset with me as I go and look for jobs after I graduate from bootcamp.
                        </p>

                        <li>Listening</li>
                        <p>Personally, I know I am a good listener. In programming though, I learned that listening is a must in every project that I will be working on. I figured out why. It is because, almost all of the time I will be working with somebody or with a number of people.
                            I need to be an excellent listener. This is my main goal as I go out there and work in the real workplace setting.
                        </p>

                        <li>Communication</li>
                        <p>Now, I know anybody can communicate, but what I am trying to develop more is to be able to articulate my thoughts and ideas to my colleagues in a concise way. It will take me months to fully develop this skill. I will get a lot of practice
                            once I am doing the bootcamp as we will be doing a lot of pair programming.
                        </p>

                    </ol>
